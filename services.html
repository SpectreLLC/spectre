        Copyediting is the foundational work applied to a written draft, and is often employed more than once by multiple editors to ensure the cleanest possible manuscript.  This practice includes the essentials of editing, correcting:

​       <br/><br/>

        Spelling
        <br/><br/>
        Punctuation
        <br/><br/>
        Grammatical structure
        <br/><br/>
        Style consistency
        <br/><br/>
        Basic syntax flow

        In need of a detailed outline for your novel or memoir?  Our writers are well practiced in organizing ideas into engaging plot lines and compelling character development.  Through a series of virtual brainstorming sessions, we will help you develop two types of outlines:

​<br/><br/>

      Traditional plot outline
<br/><br/>
      Character growth outline
<br/><br/>


      Sessions will be focused on characterization, story arcs, and major themes.  We will work from a basic, broad outline to a detailed layout with your input at every step.

        <span>$40 - $75/page<span><br/><br/>

        Also referred to as developmental editing, substantive editing involves taking a step back from a manuscript to ask several important questions:

<br/><br/>

        How does the novel flow from one section to the next?
<br/><br/>
        Are the themes consistent?
<br/><br/>
        Is there unnecessary exposition that should be omitted?
<br/><br/>
        Which chapters are weakest and could benefit from rewriting?

​<br/><br/>

        These and more.  Everything which could affect the quality of a novel on the macro level will be explored.  This type of editing is extensive, and can occasionally lead to rewriting entire sections of a manuscript.  The author will be intimately involved with every decision made during this process.
