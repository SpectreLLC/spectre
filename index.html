<p>
Unfortunately, not everyone has the means to tell their story.  Whether hindered by a busy schedule, years of being out of practice, or financial considerations, many are forced to let their authorial aspirations fade away.
<br/><br/>
Spectre Literary is in the business of rekindling those dreams.â€‹
<br/><br/>
Spectre was founded in early 2018 with a specific mission at its core: making professional ghostwriting services more accessible.</p></div>
